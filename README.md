## ðŸ“– Study Projects

This repository gathers my study projects in programming, where I build simple practice applications focused only on the essentials of what I am studying.
The main goal is to experiment with different technologies, strengthen my foundations, and continuously improve my skills in software development.

Each project represents a step in my learning journey â€” from small exercises and basic implementations to slightly more complete applications that demonstrate what I have learned.
Larger and more realistic projects will be published in separate repositories. 

## ðŸš€ Technologies I am currently studying
- **Java for Android**  
- **Angular**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **C#**  
- **JavaScript**
I plan to expand to other languages and frameworks, always aiming to learn something new and improve my skills.
